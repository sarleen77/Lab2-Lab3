This dataset simulates cardiovascular health checkup records for patients and is designed for machine learning models that predict heart disease risk.

Each row represents a patient and includes clinical, lifestyle, and behavioral factors known to influence cardiovascular health. The dataset models realistic medical relationships where high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, stress, and low physical activity increase heart disease risk.
